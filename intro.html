            <section class="content"><h2>_ about me.</h2>
                <p>Yo, I'm Yakin Jawad! I was born on August 6, 2005, and I grew up in Abu Dhabi and lived there until I graduated
                    high school when I was 16. It's been about three years since I've moved to Toronto for university, and so far it's been a blast.
                </p>
                <p>I'm currently majoring in Computer Science (4th year)
                    though my hobbies and interests range from anything between sports to video games to creative writing. As of right now,
                    I'm in the process of saving up some money to grab myself some music production equipment to mess around with. Speaking of,
                    some of my favourite genres include rap, R&B, alternative, and indie music.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not doing any of the above, I'm usually:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>going through my never-ending watch list of films/TV,</li>
                    <li>thrifting or curating my wardrobe,</li>
                    <li>getting myself a "little" treat,</li>
                    <li>listening to Blonde (as seen in Figure 1),</li>
                    <li>hanging out with my friends, or</li>
                    <li>procrastinating (I did not deserve the treat).</li>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <div class="image">
                <figure class="main_image">
                    <image src="blonde.png"></image>
                    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Blonde by Frank Ocean (2016).</figcaption>
                </figure>
